# real-time-chat-application-frontend

A lightweight, browser-based real-time chat application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**—no frameworks, no backend, just pure frontend magic. Ideal for learning DOM manipulation, event handling, and UI design.

🧠 How It Works
- Messages are sent and displayed using DOM manipulation.
- Data is stored temporarily using localStorage or in-memory arrays.
- JavaScript handles user input, timestamps, and message rendering.

📌 Limitations
- No backend/server integration (no actual socket communication)
- Messages are not persisted across sessions unless using localStorage
- Not suitable for production use without backend support

📈 Future Improvements
- Integrate with WebSocket or Firebase for real-time backend
- Add user authentication
- Store chat history in a database
